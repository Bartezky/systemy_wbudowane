# LED Panel Sorting Algorithms Visualization
### 2023/24 summer semester, Computer Science, WI, AGH University of Krakow
### Bartłomiej Walczak, Michał Sośnik

This project demonstrates the visualization of popular sorting algorithms on a HUB75 LED Panel using an ESP32. The implemented sorting algorithms include:
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Shell Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort

### Features
* Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the sorting animations using buttons.
* Menu Options: Access a menu to enable or disable the visualization of specific algorithms and choose the method of array initialization.
